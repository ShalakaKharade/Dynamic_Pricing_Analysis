# EDA-for-Feature-Selection
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach in data analysis that uses various techniques to maximize insight into a dataset, uncover underlying structure, analyze relationships between variables, detect outliers and anomalies, test underlying assumptions, and feature selection for training Machine Learning models.
This project aims to explore and analyze a dataset related to dynamic pricing for rides, with a focus on identifying key features that influence the 'Historical_Cost_of_Ride'. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights from the data and aid in feature selection for future predictive modeling tasks.
