# EDA-for-Feature-Selection
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach in data analysis that uses various techniques to maximize insight into a dataset, uncover underlying structure, analyze relationships between variables, detect outliers and anomalies, test underlying assumptions, and feature selection for training Machine Learning models.

This project aims to explore and analyze a dataset related to dynamic pricing for rides, with a focus on identifying key features that influence the 'Historical_Cost_of_Ride'. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights from the data and aid in feature selection for future predictive modeling tasks.
 
##Dataset Overview:
The dataset consists of various features that may impact the cost of rides, such as:

Number_of_Riders: Total number of riders per ride.
Number_of_Drivers: Number of available drivers at the time of booking.
Number_of_Past_Rides: Historical data on the user's past rides.
Average_Ratings: Customer ratings for previous rides.
Expected_Ride_Duration: Estimated duration of the ride.
Location_Category: Categorical variable describing the location type (e.g., Urban, Suburban).
Customer_Loyalty_Status: Loyalty status of the customer.
Time_of_Booking: Categorical feature representing the time the ride was booked.
Vehicle_Type: Type of vehicle chosen for the ride (e.g., Economy, Premium).
Historical_Cost_of_Ride: The target variable representing the historical cost of the ride.
